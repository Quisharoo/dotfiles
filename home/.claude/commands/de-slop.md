# /de-slop

Goal: Clean up messy code while preserving behavior.

Process:
1. Identify smells (dead code, long functions, duplicated logic).
2. Suggest refactor steps with rationale.
3. Highlight risks (regressions, missing tests).
4. Provide before/after snippets when useful.

Keep the tone pragmatic; focus on high-signal changes.
