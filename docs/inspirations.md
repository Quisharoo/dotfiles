# Inspiration Sources

## jxnl/dots ("dots-master")
- **Source:** https://github.com/jxnl/dots
- **Local reference:** `dots-master/` (ignored; clone for study only)
- **Author:** Jason Liu

### Key Learnings Applied
#### Zsh Enhancements
- Added oh-my-zsh plugins: `colored-man-pages`, `colorize`, `pip`, `python`, `brew`, `macos`.
- Safety aliases for destructive commands (`rm`, `mv`, `cp`) now prompt/guard.
- Quick navigation shortcuts (`..`, `...`, `c`, `cd..`).

#### Claude Structure
- Synced Claude prefs via `home/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Custom slash commands in `home/.claude/commands/` for commits, PR reviews, tests, and cleanup.

#### Not Yet Applied (Future Candidates)
- Comprehensive tmux configuration.
- Vim setup (Vundle-based) with language-specific bundles.
- Modular installer with component flags.

### License Note
Original concepts by Jason Liu. We reimplemented patterns rather than copying code verbatim.

### Cleanup Reminder
Remove the local `dots-master/` reference when youâ€™re done learning from it to keep workspace lean.
